# minimal-metro
A METRO bus tracker serving Portland and Southern Maine

Uses the [BusTime API](http://bustimeweb.smttracker.com/bustime/apidoc/docs/DeveloperAPIGuide3_0.pdf)
to return bus predictions for stop numbers.

## Setup
Just needs a web server and gulp to process the Sass. If you are offline (or no buses are running), there are sample json files in the
`json/` directory you can use to return results instead.
